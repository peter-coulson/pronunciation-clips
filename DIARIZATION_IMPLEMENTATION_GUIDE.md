# Chunked Diarization Implementation Guide
**Primary Purpose**: Maximum learning about chunking effectiveness in real development

## Learning-Focused Implementation Strategy

This guide is designed to validate chunking principles through practical implementation while capturing detailed learning insights for framework development.

### **Core Learning Objectives**
1. **Context Efficiency**: Do 2K token chunks actually provide sufficient information?
2. **Contract Accuracy**: Can we predict interfaces upfront with 90%+ accuracy?
3. **Handoff Quality**: Do chunk boundaries maintain clean information transfer?
4. **Focus Maintenance**: Do chunk scopes prevent scope creep effectively?
5. **Integration Reliability**: Can chunks integrate cleanly without rework?

### **Implementation as Learning Experiment**
Each session is a **controlled experiment** testing specific chunking hypotheses:
- **Session 0**: Can E2E tests define implementation contracts effectively?
- **Session 1**: Can foundation contracts predict ML integration needs?
- **Session 2**: Can isolated ML context produce working integration?
- **Session 3**: Can handoff documents provide sufficient context for modification?
- **Session 4**: Can pipeline integration work through contracts alone?
- **Session 5**: Can CLI implementation leverage previous chunk outputs?

## Session Implementation Sequence

### **Session 0: E2E Test Definition (60 min) - MANDATORY FIRST**
**Learning Hypothesis**: E2E tests can define implementation contracts effectively
**Context Load**: `DIARIZATION_E2E_CONTEXT.md`

```bash
"Implement complete E2E test suite BEFORE any implementation.
Load: DIARIZATION_E2E_CONTEXT.md
Scope: All 5 E2E tests - immutable contracts for final validation
Target: Complete test suite implemented, fixtures configured, success criteria defined"
```

**Learning Capture**: 
- Did E2E specs provide sufficient implementation guidance?
- How accurate were predicted integration points?
- What implementation details were missing from specs?

**Generate**: `HANDOFF-0.md` (E2E contracts for implementation chunks)

---

### **Session 1: Foundation & Models (45 min)**
**Learning Hypothesis**: Foundation contracts can predict ML integration needs
**Context Load**: `/context/domains/standards.md` + `HANDOFF-0.md`

```bash
"Implement diarization foundation: models and configuration only.
Load: /context/domains/standards.md + HANDOFF-0.md
Scope: SpeakerSegment dataclass, DiarizationConfig, speaker_id: int migration
Target: Foundation contracts complete, unit tests passing"
```

**Learning Capture**:
- Was context sufficient for foundation implementation?
- Did E2E handoff provide clear model requirements?
- How accurate were predicted data structures?

**Generate**: `HANDOFF-1.md` (Foundation interfaces for ML module)

---

### **Session 2: ML Diarization Module (60 min)**
**Learning Hypothesis**: Isolated ML context can produce working integration
**Context Load**: `DIARIZATION_CHUNK2_CONTEXT.md` + `HANDOFF-1.md`

```bash
"Implement core ML diarization module only.
Load: DIARIZATION_CHUNK2_CONTEXT.md + HANDOFF-1.md
Scope: src/audio_to_json/diarization.py complete implementation  
Target: SpeakerDiarizer working, dependencies handled, unit tests passing"
```

**Learning Capture**:
- Did 2K token context contain sufficient ML implementation guidance?
- How well did foundation handoff provide required interfaces?
- What external context was needed beyond chunk context?

**Generate**: `HANDOFF-2.md` (ML interfaces for entity integration)

---

### **Session 3: Entity Integration (45 min)**
**Learning Hypothesis**: Handoff documents provide sufficient context for modification
**Context Load**: `entity_creation.py` + `HANDOFF-2.md`

```bash
"Modify entity creation to use speaker segments.
Load: existing entity_creation.py + HANDOFF-2.md
Scope: _assign_speaker_id() method modification only
Target: Speaker assignment from segments, backward compatibility, tests passing"
```

**Learning Capture**:
- Did handoff document provide sufficient integration context?
- How well did existing code + contracts enable focused modification?
- What scope creep temptations occurred?

**Generate**: `HANDOFF-3.md` (Entity integration for pipeline)

---

### **Session 4: Pipeline Integration (45 min)**
**Learning Hypothesis**: Pipeline integration works through contracts alone
**Context Load**: `DIARIZATION_CHUNK4_CONTEXT.md` + `HANDOFF-3.md`

```bash
"Add diarization stage to pipeline.  
Load: DIARIZATION_CHUNK4_CONTEXT.md + HANDOFF-3.md
Scope: Pipeline Stage 2.5 addition only
Target: Optional diarization in pipeline, config-driven, tests passing"
```

**Learning Capture**:
- How well did chunk context + handoffs enable clean integration?
- Did pipeline modification stay within chunk boundaries?
- What coordination complexity emerged?

**Generate**: `HANDOFF-4.md` (Pipeline interfaces for CLI)

---

### **Session 5: CLI Commands (45 min)**
**Learning Hypothesis**: CLI implementation can leverage previous chunk outputs
**Context Load**: CLI patterns + `HANDOFF-4.md`

```bash
"Implement speaker management CLI commands.
Load: existing CLI patterns + HANDOFF-4.md
Scope: label_speakers and analyze_speakers commands
Target: CLI functionality complete, tests passing"
```

**Learning Capture**:
- Did previous chunk outputs provide sufficient CLI integration context?
- How well did CLI patterns + handoffs enable rapid development?
- What database integration complexity emerged?

**Generate**: `HANDOFF-5.md` (Complete system interfaces)

---

### **Session 6: Final Validation (30 min)**
**Learning Hypothesis**: Chunked implementation passes original E2E contracts
**Context Load**: Original E2E tests + `HANDOFF-5.md`

```bash
"Validate complete system against original E2E tests.
Load: Original E2E tests from Session 0
Scope: Run tests, validate performance, confirm success criteria
Target: All E2E tests passing, chunking approach validated"
```

**Learning Capture**:
- Do all E2E tests pass without modification?
- How well did chunked implementation meet original contracts?
- What integration issues emerged during final validation?

**Final Assessment**: Complete chunking effectiveness analysis

## Learning Protocol

### **Per Session Learning Capture**
After each session, immediately update `CHUNKING_LEARNINGS_LOG.md`:

1. **Context Sufficiency** (1-5 rating): Did loaded context provide enough information?
2. **Focus Maintenance** (1-5 rating): How well did you stay within chunk scope?
3. **Contract Accuracy** (1-5 rating): How accurate were predicted interfaces?
4. **Integration Friction**: What handoff or integration issues occurred?
5. **Unexpected Needs**: What context or information was missing?

### **Between Sessions**
- **Clean Git State**: Commit after each chunk completion
- **Generate Handoffs**: Document interfaces and context for next chunk
- **Update Progress**: Track completion in learning log
- **Prepare Context**: Ensure next session has required files ready

### **Success Criteria**

**Technical Success**:
- All E2E tests passing without modification
- Performance targets met (2-4x realtime)
- Speaker detection accuracy >85%
- Complete backward compatibility

**Learning Success**:
- Clear evidence whether chunking improves development velocity
- Documented patterns for effective chunk boundaries
- Validated handoff mechanisms for context preservation
- Evidence-based recommendations for chunking MVP
