# Chunking Implementation Learnings Log

## Purpose
Capture real-world insights from implementing diarization using simplified chunking principles. These learnings will directly inform the chunking system MVP design.

## System Expectations (Baseline for Comparison)

### **Framework Implementation Expectations**
Based on the comprehensive development framework and chunking principles established:

#### **E2E Test Immutability** 
- **Expectation**: Once E2E tests are written (Session 0), they CANNOT be modified during implementation
- **Validation**: All implementation sessions must work toward making existing tests pass
- **Success Criteria**: Final system passes all original E2E tests without test modifications

#### **Contract-Driven Development**
- **Expectation**: Chunk interfaces defined upfront accurately predict actual integration needs
- **Validation**: Handoffs between chunks work without interface modifications
- **Success Criteria**: Clean integration without contract rework

#### **Context Isolation Effectiveness**
- **Expectation**: 2K token chunk contexts contain sufficient information for implementation
- **Validation**: Minimal external context loading required during chunk sessions
- **Success Criteria**: High implementation velocity with focused context

#### **Sequential Implementation Discipline**
- **Expectation**: Strict chunk boundaries prevent scope creep and maintain focus
- **Validation**: Each session stays within defined chunk scope
- **Success Criteria**: No cross-chunk modifications during individual sessions

#### **Testing Progression Reliability**
- **Expectation**: Unit → Integration → E2E test progression catches issues early
- **Validation**: Test failures at appropriate levels, early error detection

## Learning Collection Process

### **During Implementation**
- **Real-time notes**: Keep brief notes during each session
- **Context tracking**: Note what context you actually used vs loaded
- **Time tracking**: Record actual vs estimated durations
- **Integration points**: Document handoff successes/failures

### **After Each Session**
- **Immediate reflection**: 5-10 minute session retrospective
- **Contract validation**: Check if interfaces worked as expected
- **Update learning templates**: Fill out session-specific insights

### **After Complete Implementation**
- **Pattern analysis**: Look for recurring themes across sessions
- **Framework recommendations**: Synthesize implications for chunking MVP
- **Validation priorities**: Identify which patterns need more testing

## Key Questions to Answer

### **Context System Integration**
- Should chunking use separate context system or integrate with existing?
- What's the optimal context loading pattern for chunks?
- How should chunk contexts relate to domain contexts?

### **Contract Definition Process**
- How accurate were upfront contract predictions?
- What contract definition process works best?
- Which interface patterns caused integration issues?

### **Parallel Execution Readiness**
- Which chunks could actually run in parallel?
- What coordination overhead would parallel execution require?
- How would error handling work in parallel chunk development?

### **Framework Architecture Decisions**
- Should chunking be additive to current system or replacement?
- What's the minimum viable chunking system based on real usage?
- Which framework features provide the most value vs complexity?

## Usage Instructions

1. **Start logging before Session 1** - capture initial expectations
2. **Update after each session** - while insights are fresh
3. **Weekly pattern review** - look for emerging themes
4. **Post-implementation analysis** - synthesize for framework design

This log becomes the foundation for evidence-based chunking MVP development rather than theoretical framework design.
