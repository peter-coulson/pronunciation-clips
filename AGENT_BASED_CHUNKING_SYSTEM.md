# Agent-Based Chunking System

## What Has Been Defined

- **Core workflow structure**: Two-phase execution with specialized agents and document-based coordination
- **Scale boundaries**: 4-25 chunk system with proven experimental effectiveness metrics
- **Testing foundation**: E2E test immutability and sequential validation requirements
- **Architecture constraints**: Stateless agent design aligned with Task tool limitations

## What Is Yet To Be Defined

### **CRITICAL FOR MVP** (Required Upfront)

#### **Core Communication & Coordination**
- **Template specification standards**: Input specification, handoff document, context package, summary report formats
- **Handoff document implementation**: Concrete standards beyond reference examples
- **Methodology to prompt translation**: How workflow rules get encoded into actual agent instruction files
- **Control and Sub-Agent behaviors**: Specific decision-making prompts and communication patterns

#### **Essential Workflow Components**
- **Phase B implementation**: Module decomposition techniques and boundary decision patterns
- **Interface contract specifications**: Detailed input/output relationship definitions with validation criteria
- **Dependency mapping protocols**: Sequential execution order determination methods
- **Test specification placement**: Where unit, integration, and chunk-level E2E tests are defined and managed
- **Main Agent coordination details**: Process orchestration, report interpretation, and error recovery implementation

#### **Basic System Operations**
- **Session lifecycle management**: Creation, execution, archival, and reference workflows within context system
- **Failure handling mechanisms**: Basic recovery procedures, restart vs escalation decision criteria

#### **Quality Gates***
- **Input specification validation**: Completeness criteria and gap identification procedures*
- **Template validation protocols**: Quality gates and validation procedures for communication backbone*

*Can start with manual review for MVP

### **POST-MVP ADDITIONS** (Add Later Through Trial & Error)

- Advanced Recovery & Resilience
- Optimization & Metrics
- Resource Management
- User Experience Enhancements

## System Overview

A simple, prompt-based chunking system that leverages Claude's proven architectural decision-making capabilities while providing structure and coordination for complex implementation projects. The system uses a Control Agent to analyze specifications and coordinate Sub-Agents that implement individual chunks, enabling parallel execution where dependencies allow.

## Core Goals

1. **Preserve Claude's Judgment** - Control Agent makes all chunking decisions using proven patterns
2. **Enable Parallel Execution** - Sub-Agents implement independent chunks simultaneously 
3. **Maintain Integration Quality** - Contract-based handoffs ensure seamless chunk integration
4. **Repository Agnostic** - Works with any codebase without complex setup
5. **Leverage Proven Patterns** - Built on 5/5 effectiveness experiment results (4.8/5 context management, 95% contract accuracy, 120% velocity)

- `/context/chunking/examples/HANDOFF-*.md` - Quality handoff examples
- `/context/domains/standards.md` - Development standards
- `diarization_implementation.md` - Reference specification format



## Implementation Approach

### Control Agent Commands
```
- "Start chunking session with specification: [spec-file.md]"
- "Resume chunking development"
- "Archive completed session and update main context"
```


## Success Criteria
- Zero context pollution within existing repository system
- Clean session lifecycle: creation → execution → archival → reference
- Simple prompt-based coordination without complex automation
