# Data Models & Processing

## Colombian Spanish Specific Requirements
- **Smart Buffering Implementation**: Fixed 50ms buffer causes word overlap in Colombian Spanish continuous speech
- **Zero-Gap Detection**: Must check `word[n].end_time == word[n+1].start_time` before adding buffer
- **Gap-Based Buffering**: Only add buffer when natural gaps exist between words
- **Validated Configuration**: Use proven thresholds from Colombian Spanish testing (min_confidence: 0.8, syllable_range: [2, 6])
