# Chunking System Workflow

## Input Structure
The input to this system will come from a combination of:
- Repository main context for generic project wide guidelines
- A highly detailed file containing all the necessary specifications for the chunking system to implement the changes

This should allow for very little decisions made by the chunking system as they should be predefined in this file or in the repository context.

## Failure Handling & Recovery (to be defined later)

**Initial Approach**: Start with minimal failure handling that can be implemented and improved as the MVP is used in production

## Workflow Steps

### **Phase 1: Planning & Preparation**

#### **1. Input Validation**
- **Agent**: Input Validation Agent
- **Output**: Validation report
- **Success Gate**: Specification complete

#### **2. E2E Test Setup**  
- **Agent**: E2E Setup Agent (only agent with E2E modification rights)
- **Output**: Operational E2E tests
- **Success Gate**: All tests executable

#### **3. Chunking Analysis** (Critical Success Path)
- **Agent**: Chunking Analysis Agent  
- **Phase A**: Scale validation (4-25 chunk limits)
- **Phase B**: Module decomposition and context preparation
- **Outputs**: SCALE-VALIDATION.md, DEPENDENCY-CHART.md, COORDINATION-PLAN.md, chunk contexts and contracts
- **Success Gate**: Scale validated, all contexts complete

### **Phase 2: Sequential Implementation**

#### **4. Sequential Chunk Implementation**
- **Coordination**: Main agent orchestrates based on dependency chart
- **Per-Chunk Process**: Context loading → Implementation → Testing → Contract validation → Handoff generation
- **Failure Handling**: Failed chunks restart with same context, no cascade failures

#### **5. Final Validation**
Main agent runs all tests, implements fixes until working, generates final report

#### **6. Context System Update**
Update main context system with results, track system success metrics
