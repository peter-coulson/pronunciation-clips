# Main Agent Coordination Architecture

## Document-Based Coordination Model
**Approach**: Document-based coordination aligns with Task tool constraints
- **Stateless Agents**: Complete context via documents, no state sharing
- **File System Handoffs**: Inter-agent communication through documents
- **Upfront Planning**: Dependencies resolved by Analysis Agent
- **Token Boundaries**: Agents operate within prepared contexts

## Input Validation Agent Integration
**Coordination Role**: First agent in workflow, feeds Chunking Analysis Agent

## Main Agent Responsibilities (to be fleshed out)
- **Process Orchestration**: Sequences specialized agents based on dependency chart
- **Report Interpretation**: Analyzes sub-agent outputs for success/failure states
- **Final Validation**: Ensures all tests pass before completion
- **Error Recovery**: Determines restart vs escalation procedures

## Progress Tracking Protocols
- **Main Progress**: Chunking progress captured in CLAUDE.md
- **State Management**: Tracks completion status of each agent across phases
