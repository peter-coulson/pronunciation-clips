# Testing Strategy

## System Foundation
The foundation of the system is its test driven framework. This starts with the main predefined E2E testing scenarios in the input file. These E2E tests will be solely for the entire implementation and not at the chunk level.

## Testing Strategy

### **E2E Test Rules**
- **Input Specification**: E2E test requirements must be specified in the main input file
- **Translation**: Input Validation Agent translates requirements to detailed E2E test specifications in system template
- **Implementation**: E2E Setup Agent creates actual tests from detailed specifications
- **Immutability Principle**: Once E2E tests are created by E2E Setup Agent, they cannot be modified by any subsequent agent
- **Implementation Timing**: E2E tests created before any chunk implementation begins

### **Unit and Integration Test Requirements**
- **Contract Fulfillment**: Chunk contracts are only fulfilled when all unit tests, integration tests, and chunk-level E2E tests pass for the chunk
- **Test Specification Location**: Must still decide exactly where in the system all of these tests are specified
- **Final Validation**: All tests including module-level E2E tests must pass at the end before completion (main agent validates and corrects)

### **Two-Level E2E Testing**
- **Module-Level E2E Tests**: Test the complete feature end-to-end (created by E2E Setup Agent at start)
- **Chunk-Level E2E Tests**: Test individual chunks in isolation but end-to-end within their scope (specified in chunk contracts)
- **Purpose**: Module-level ensures integration, chunk-level ensures component correctness

### **To Be Specified**
- How and where the unit, integration, and chunk-level E2E testing requirements for each chunk contracts are to be specified
