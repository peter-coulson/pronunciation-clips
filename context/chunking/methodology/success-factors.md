# Critical Success Factors

## **1. Chunking Analysis Agent Quality** (Highest Priority)
The entire system success depends on this agent's analysis quality:
- **Context Preparation**: Must create contexts sufficient for implementation without additional analysis
- **Interface Accuracy**: Contract predictions must achieve >90% accuracy (proven standard from experimental results)
- **Dependency Mapping**: Sequential dependency chains must be accurate and complete
- **Scope Definition**: Chunk boundaries must align with natural implementation units

**Mitigation**: Invest heavily in this agent's prompts, validation procedures, and testing with pilot modules.

## **2. Handoff Document Standards** (Make-or-Break Element)
As validated in experimental implementation, handoff quality enables zero-friction implementation:
- **Interface Specifications**: Must include working examples and usage patterns
- **Implementation Context**: Complete integration patterns and error handling approaches
- **Success Criteria**: Clear validation requirements and testing specifications
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and resolution approaches

**Reference Standard**: Maintain quality equivalent to `/context/chunking/examples/HANDOFF-2.md` proven patterns.

## **3. Context Size Management**
- **Target**: 3-4K token contexts (validated experimental range)
- **Risk**: Chunking Analysis Agent requiring excessive context for large module analysis
- **Mitigation**: Focus agent on architectural analysis rather than detailed implementation planning

## **4. Sequential Execution Discipline**
- **Dependency Isolation**: Each chunk must complete fully before dependent chunks begin
- **Test Validation**: All unit tests and contract validation must pass before handoff
- **Scope Boundaries**: Implementation agents must stay within defined chunk boundaries
- **Error Isolation**: Failed chunks must not cascade to completed work

## **5. Tool Constraint Alignment**
- **Stateless Agent Design**: Each implementation agent must work independently with document-based context
- **Document-Based Coordination**: All inter-agent communication through file system handoffs
- **Task Tool Usage**: Focused, single-purpose agent invocations with complete context
- **No Runtime Coordination**: All dependency relationships resolved through upfront planning

## Proven Patterns (Experimental Results)
- **Context Size**: 3-4K tokens effective (4.8/5 rating)
- **Contract Accuracy**: 95% interface prediction accuracy
- **Development Velocity**: 120% of expected timeline
- **Integration Failures**: Zero when contracts accurate
- **E2E Test Immutability**: Tests unchanged throughout implementation
