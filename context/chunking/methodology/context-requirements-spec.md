# Context Requirements Specification

## Input Translation Process
**Input Validation Agent** transforms user input:
1. Validate completeness
2. Translate to system template
3. Identify gaps
4. Integrate with repository context

## Context Categories - Natural Technical Boundaries

The system divides input context into four categories based on **natural technical boundaries** - each requirement has a clear home based on its source of authority:

### 1. Chunking System Context
Context related to the chunking system's functionality or methods.
- **Source**: `/context/chunking/methodology/*`
- **Boundary**: System coordination and methodology requirements

**Core Components**:
- **Testing Strategy**: Universal execution rules
  - E2E test immutability principle (tests cannot be modified after setup)
  - Contract fulfillment requirements (all tests must pass before chunk completion)
- **What this means in practice**:
  - The specifics of testing implementation in the rest of the context outside of the E2E tests can be light.
  - We can also go into detail about the testing strategies to use and the system should take these into account.
  - It will be the role of the chunking creation agent to put these into practice.

### 2. Repository Level Context  
**System cannot proceed** without these being defined in the repository's context system.
- **Source**: `/context/domains/`, `/context/standards/`, `/context/patterns/`
- **Boundary**: Inferable from existing codebase patterns and established project standards
- **Examples**: Dependencies, tech stack, architecture patterns, development standards, file organization
- **Blocker**: If missing, chunking system fails

### 3. Area Level Context
For specific technology areas, **system cannot proceed** without the specific protocols/frameworks being defined.
- **Source**: `/context/domains/` technology-specific files
- **Boundary**: Technology-specific patterns and frameworks for backend, frontend, database, etc.
- **Examples**: API frameworks, database patterns, authentication methods, deployment strategies
- **Blocker**: If missing for relevant project areas, chunking system fails

### 4. Implementation Level Context
User **must specify** because it's not inferable from repository patterns or technology standards.
- **Source**: User specification only
- **Boundary**: Business-specific logic, feature requirements, user workflows
- **Examples**: Business rules, user stories, specific feature behavior, domain logic
- **Requirement**: Must be complete in user input for system to proceed

## System Integration Points

### Agent First Action Workflow
1. **Input Validation Agent** receives user-facing template
2. Read categories 1-3 from context system
3. Translate user input to complete system template
4. Extract category 4 from completed system template
5. Combine into single input for Chunking Analysis Agent
6. Proceed with Phase A (Scale Validation)

## Input Template Requirements Analysis

### Comprehensive Requirements Collection (`input_template_requirements.md`)

**Purpose**: Complete capture of all possible input requirements
- **Status**: Temporary analytical document (DO NOT MODIFY)
- **Usage**: Categorization and boundary definition only
- **Process**: Will be refined after categorization is complete

## Critical Design Constraints

- **Validation**: Implementation Level Context must be complete upfront
- **Translation Quality**: User input must map to complete system requirements
- **Token Limits**: Combined context must fit within agent processing limits

## Boundary Classification Strategy

### The Real Challenge
**How do we systematically determine which of the 646+ requirements belong to which natural category?**

This is a **classification problem**, not an optimization problem. Each requirement has a natural home based on:
- **Repository/Area Level**: Inferable from existing code patterns and technology choices
- **Implementation Level**: Business/feature-specific requirements not derivable from codebase
- **Chunking System**: Coordination and methodology requirements

### Override Strategy (Recommended)
**Systematic Prioritization**: `System → Area → Specific`

Instead of complex boundary decisions, use hierarchical override:
```
Repository Level: "Use REST APIs"
Area Level: "Use Express.js for REST APIs" 
Specific Level: "Use Express.js with JWT auth for user APIs"
```

**Benefits**:
- **Simplicity**: No boundary ambiguity
- **Consistency**: Clear precedence rules
- **Maintainability**: Each layer adds specificity
- **Robustness**: Most specific specification wins

### Critical Boundary (Only One That Matters)
**System-Inferable** (Repository + Area + Chunking) vs **User-Must-Specify** (Implementation)

All other categorization is internal system organization optimized for consistency, not perfect classification.

## Requirements Specification Structure

### Dual-Purpose Requirements Files
Each requirements specification serves dual purposes:
1. **Information Gathering Guide**: What to collect and from where
2. **Validation Specification**: Criteria for completeness and correctness

### File Structure & Homes
```
/context/chunking/requirements/
├── system-requirements.md          # System-level info requirements
├── areas/
│   ├── backend-api-requirements.md
│   ├── frontend-web-requirements.md  
│   ├── database-requirements.md
│   └── auth-requirements.md
└── implementation-requirements.md   # User-specific info requirements
```

### Requirements File Structure
```markdown
## Information Requirements
### Must Gather - [Specific data points with sources]
### Must Validate - [Validation criteria and conditions]

## Context Sources
### Repository Context Patterns - [Where to look in repository]
### User Input Requirements - [What user must specify]
### Inference Rules - [How to derive missing information]
```

This eliminates ambiguity - Claude knows exactly what to collect, where to find it, and how to validate sufficiency.

## Context Collection Strategy

### Unified Context Collection Process
System and area context should be treated as the same process with prioritization hierarchy respected:

#### Single Collection Phase
Claude processes all context sources simultaneously, applying override hierarchy:

1. **Multi-Source Template Filling**
   - System requirements → Repository context + user input (user wins)
   - Area requirements → Repository context + user input (user wins)  
   - Implementation requirements → User input only

2. **Priority Resolution During Collection**
   ```
   User Input > Repository Patterns > Inference
   ```

3. **Unified Template Population**
   - All templates filled in single pass
   - Conflicts resolved by hierarchy during population
   - No sequential system → area → specific workflow

**Benefits**: Maintains hierarchy while simplifying process - no complex multi-phase template coordination needed.

## Outstanding Design Issues

### Validation Process Architecture Problem
**Issue**: Without a separate validation stage or agent, there is large risk of improper validation of template completeness and correctness.

**Problem Statement**: The context collection process may result in:
- Incomplete template population with unnoticed gaps
- Insufficient validation against requirements specifications  
- Subjective judgment about "good enough" specifications
- Proceeding to chunking with inadequate context

**Requirements for Solution**:
- Objective validation against requirements specifications
- Clear success/failure criteria for template completeness
- Systematic gap identification with specific remediation guidance
- Prevention of proceeding with insufficient specifications

**Solution**: *To be defined*
