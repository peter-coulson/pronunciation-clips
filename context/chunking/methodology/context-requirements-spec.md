# Context Requirements Specification

## Context Categories

The system divides input context into four distinct categories for structured agent processing:

### 1. Chunking System Context
Context related to the chunking system's functionality or methods.
- **Source**: `/context/chunking/methodology/*`

**Core Components**:
- **Testing Strategy**: Universal execution rules
  - E2E test immutability principle (tests cannot be modified after setup)
  - Contract fulfillment requirements (all tests must pass before chunk completion)
- **What this means in practice**:
  - The specifics of testing implementation in the rest of the context outside of the E2E tests can be light.
  - We can also go into detail about the testing strategies to use and the system should take these into account.
  - It will be the role of the chunking creation agent to put these into practice.

### 2. Repository Level Context  
Software standards, dependencies, other modules, development patterns.
- **Source**: `/context/domains/`, `/context/standards/`, `/context/patterns/`, ... perhaps more context folders. 
- **Auto-populated**: Yes (system reads from context system)

### 3. Area Level Context
Technologies used for implementation (API frameworks, frontend frameworks, backend etc.).
- **Source**: `/context/domains/` technology-specific files
- **Auto-populated**: Partial (system detects, user validates/supplements)

### 4. Implementation Level Context
Context not included in above categories that must be specified in user input.
- **Source**: User specification only

## System Integration Points

### Agent First Action Workflow
1. Read categories 1-3 from context system
2. Extract category 4 from user input specification  
3. Combine into single input for Chunking Analysis Agent
4. Proceed with Phase A (Scale Validation)

## Critical Design Constraints

- **Validation**: Implementation Level Context completeness must be validated upfront
- **Combination Logic**: Categories must merge without duplication or conflicts
- **Token Limits**: Combined context must fit within agent processing limits
