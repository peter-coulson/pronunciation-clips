# Context Requirements Specification

## Requirements Categories - Natural Technical Boundaries

The system divides input requirements into three categories based on **natural technical boundaries** - each requirement has a clear home based on its source of authority:

### 1. Repository Level Requirements
**System cannot proceed** without these being defined in the repository's context system.
- **Source**: `/context/domains/`, `/context/standards/`, `/context/patterns/`
- **Boundary**: Inferable from existing codebase patterns and established project standards
- **Examples**: Dependencies, tech stack, architecture patterns, development standards, file organization
- **Blocker**: If missing, chunking system fails

### 2. Area Level Requirements
For specific technology areas, **system cannot proceed** without the specific protocols/frameworks being defined.
- **Source**: `/context/domains/` technology-specific files
- **Boundary**: Technology-specific patterns and frameworks for backend, frontend, database, etc.
- **Examples**: API frameworks, database patterns, authentication methods, deployment strategies
- **Blocker**: If missing for relevant project areas, chunking system fails

### 3. Implementation Level Requirements
User **must specify** because it's not inferable from repository patterns or technology standards.
- **Source**: User specification only
- **Boundary**: Business-specific logic, feature requirements, user workflows
- **Examples**: Business rules, user stories, specific feature behavior, domain logic, testing requirements beyond E2E tests
- **Requirement**: Must be complete in user input for system to proceed

**Note on Testing**: Testing requirements outside of main E2E tests can be specified lightly in implementation requirements, as the chunking system methodology already defines universal execution rules (E2E test immutability principle and contract fulfillment requirements).

## Input Template Requirements Analysis

### Comprehensive Requirements Collection (`input_template_requirements.md`)

**Purpose**: Complete capture of all possible input requirements
- **Status**: Temporary analytical document (DO NOT MODIFY)
- **Usage**: Categorization and boundary definition only
- **Process**: Will be refined after categorization is complete

## Critical Design Constraints

- **Validation**: Implementation Level Context must be complete upfront
- **Translation Quality**: User input must map to complete system requirements
- **Token Limits**: Combined context must fit within agent processing limits

## Boundary Classification Strategy

### The Real Challenge
**How do we systematically determine which of the 646+ requirements belong to which natural category?**

This is a **classification problem**, not an optimization problem. Each requirement has a natural home based on:
- **Repository/Area Level**: Inferable from existing code patterns and technology choices
- **Implementation Level**: Business/feature-specific requirements not derivable from codebase
- **Chunking System**: Coordination and methodology requirements

### Override Strategy (Recommended)
**Systematic Prioritization**: `System → Area → Specific`

Instead of complex boundary decisions, use hierarchical override:
```
Repository Level: "Use REST APIs"
Area Level: "Use Express.js for REST APIs" 
Specific Level: "Use Express.js with JWT auth for user APIs"
```

**Benefits**:
- **Simplicity**: No boundary ambiguity
- **Consistency**: Clear precedence rules
- **Maintainability**: Each layer adds specificity
- **Robustness**: Most specific specification wins

### Critical Boundary
**System-Inferable** (Repository + Area) vs **User-Must-Specify** (Implementation)

The three-category structure provides natural technical boundaries for requirements organization and template population.

## Requirements Specification Structure

### Dual-Purpose Requirements Files
Each requirements specification serves dual purposes:
1. **Information Gathering Guide**: What to collect and from where
2. **Validation Specification**: Criteria for completeness and correctness

### File Structure & Homes
```
/context/chunking/requirements/
├── repository-requirements.md       # Repository-level info requirements
├── areas/
│   ├── backend-api-requirements.md
│   ├── frontend-web-requirements.md  
│   ├── database-requirements.md
│   └── auth-requirements.md
└── implementation-requirements.md   # User-specific info requirements
```

### Requirements File Structure
```markdown
## Information Requirements
### Must Gather - [Specific data points with sources]
### Must Validate - [Validation criteria and conditions]

## Context Sources
### Repository Context Patterns - [Where to look in repository]
### User Input Requirements - [What user must specify]
### Inference Rules - [How to derive missing information]
```

This eliminates ambiguity - Claude knows exactly what to collect, where to find it, and how to validate sufficiency.

## Context Collection Strategy

### Unified Context Collection Process
System and area context should be treated as the same process with prioritization hierarchy respected:

#### Single Collection Phase
Input Validation Agent processes all requirements sources, applying override hierarchy:

1. **Multi-Source Template Filling**
   - Repository requirements → Repository context + user input (user wins)
   - Area requirements → Repository context + user input (user wins)  
   - Implementation requirements → User input only

2. **Priority Resolution During Collection**
   ```
   User Input > Repository Patterns > Inference
   ```

3. **Template Population**
   - Requirements templates filled in single validation pass
   - Conflicts resolved by hierarchy during population
   - Agent translates user input to complete system specification

**Benefits**: Maintains hierarchy while simplifying process - no complex multi-phase template coordination needed.

## Outstanding Design Issues

### Validation Process Architecture Problem
**Issue**: Without a separate validation stage or agent, there is large risk of improper validation of template completeness and correctness.

**Problem Statement**: The context collection process may result in:
- Incomplete template population with unnoticed gaps
- Insufficient validation against requirements specifications  
- Subjective judgment about "good enough" specifications
- Proceeding to chunking with inadequate context

**Requirements for Solution**:
- Objective validation against requirements specifications
- Clear success/failure criteria for template completeness
- Systematic gap identification with specific remediation guidance
- Prevention of proceeding with insufficient specifications

**Solution**: *To be defined*
