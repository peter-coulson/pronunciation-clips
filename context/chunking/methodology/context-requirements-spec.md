# Context Requirements Problem Definition

## System Overview

The chunking system requires comprehensive specification planning before agents can safely implement without making incorrect assumptions. The challenge is designing a specification amalgamation and validation system that ensures completeness.

## Core Problem

**User Template + Context Input**: Sparse foundational context stored in the context system + a high level implementation plan including E2E test criteria
**System Need**: A single implementation plan input from which it makes no major archetectural assumptions during implementation
**Current Gap**: No systematic way to expand sparse input into comprehensive requirements and validate completeness of archtectural decisions + system context

## System Flow

1. **Requirements Template**: Stored in chunking context system (not user-provided)
2. **Requirements Inference**: Claude expands sparse user input into comprehensive detailed requirements specific to this implementation
3. **Requirements Population**: Claude attempts to fill detailed requirements from user input + context system
4. **Requirements Validation**: System fails if any requirements cannot be populated completely
5. **Implementation Handoff**: Only proceeds with complete requirements specification

## Key Constraint

**No Implementation Inference**: Claude must never guess key implementation details. All essential implementation context must be explicitly specified in requirements before any implementation begins. The level of acceptable implementation abstraction is yet to be defined.

## Specification Sources

1. **User Input**: Business intent, feature descriptions, constraints, E2E tests.
2. **Repository Context**: Existing codebase patterns, established standards (`/context/domains/`, `/context/standards/`)  

## Requirements Level Abstraction Level Challenge 

**Too Abstract**: Claude may miss requirements areas when generating within standard system functionality
**Too Detailed**: The requirements may become too specific and not relevant to the implementation. This also wastes tokens
**Optimal Level**: Detailed enough for Claude to create accurate specific requirements all relevant to the implementation

## Implementation Level Abstraction Level Challenge 

**Too Abstract**: Critical system or implementation assumptions become necessary
**Too Detailed**: Wastes the users time overspecifying what claude can safely assume
**Optimal Level**: The minimum level of context where no critical assumptions are made

Through running of the MVP the user can adjust these to find the optimal level. 

## Experimental Data Resource

**MVP Success Patterns**: Proven abstraction boundaries that worked in successful chunking implementations provide calibration data for requirement detail levels.

## Critical Unknowns

1. **Requirements Abstraction Level for MVP**: What granularity should initial requirements templates use?
2. **Experimental Data Calibration**: How to extract abstract requirements from MVP data?
3. **Validation Architecture**: Separate validation agent vs unified agent approach?
4. **Agent Instruction Abstraction**: How abstractly can the system and implementation details be described to Claude?
5. **Failure Feedback Mechanism**: How does Claude indicate what requirements are missing?

## Success Criteria

The requirements validation system must:
- Prevent agents from making critical implementation assumptions
- Provide complete context for reliable chunking decisions 
- Fail gracefully with actionable feedback when requirements are insufficient
- Scale across different project types and complexity levels
