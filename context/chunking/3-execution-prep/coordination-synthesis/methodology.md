# Phase 3: Coordination Synthesis Methodology

## Objective
Transform Phase 1-2 outputs into execution-ready coordination plan using template population synthesis.

## Input Requirements
- **BOUNDARY_ANALYSIS_TEMPLATE.md** (Phase 1) - chunk boundaries, execution sequence, parallel groups
- **chunk-[N]-[name]/CONTEXT.md** files (Phase 2) - filtered behavioral contexts
- **Context Extraction Output** (original) - feature name, completion criteria

## Method: Template Population Synthesis

### Step 1: Input Parsing
Extract structured data from Phase 1-2 outputs:
- Chunk names and descriptions from boundary analysis
- Dependency chains and parallel groups from execution sequence
- Context sizes and sources from filtered contexts

### Step 2: Context Mapping
Map Phase 1-2 outputs to coordination sections:
- Individual chunk contexts → Context Distribution, Agent Requirements, Completion Criteria
- Boundary analysis → Handoff Specifications, Error Handling, Resource Requirements

### Step 3: Template Population
Fill COORDINATION_PLAN_TEMPLATE.md systematically:
- Implementation Overview from chunk descriptions
- Execution Sequence from dependency analysis
- Handoff Specifications from interface boundaries
- Completion Criteria from behavioral requirements

### Step 4: Validation
Ensure coordination completeness:
- All chunks have handoff specs and completion criteria
- Execution sequence matches dependency analysis
- Context distribution covers all chunks

## Output
**COORDINATION_PLAN.md** - Complete execution orchestration ready for handoff to execution agents.

## Success Criteria
- All Phase 1-2 outputs integrated into single coordination document
- Execution sequence preserves dependency constraints
- Context distribution enables autonomous chunk execution
