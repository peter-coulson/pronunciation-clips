# Consolidated Input Template Requirements

## Core Principle
Every major design decision must be pre-specified so agents make ZERO implementation assumptions. This is everything Claude Code could possibly need to know.

*This comprehensive collection represents everything that could possibly be specified in an input template for an agent-based chunking system. The goal is to ensure that every major design decision has been made and specified upfront, so that agent implementation need not make assumptions about architecture, structure, testing approach, or end-to-end requirements.*
