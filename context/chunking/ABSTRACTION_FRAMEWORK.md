# Implementation Abstraction Framework

## Core Categories

### Abstraction Levels (How Concrete)
Sequential refinement from business intent to executable code:

1. **Business Requirements** - What the system should accomplish from user/stakeholder perspective
2. **System Design** - Architecture patterns, component relationships, data flows
3. **Interface Specification** - Module boundaries, data schemas, component contracts
4. **Behavioral Specification** - Test cases, expected behaviors, error conditions
5. **Implementation Strategy** - Algorithms, internal logic flows, design patterns
6. **Function Signatures** - Exact method contracts, parameters, return types
7. **Code Implementation** - Actual syntax, variable names, implementation details

### Context Types (What External Knowledge)
Orthogonal requirements needed at any abstraction level:

1. **Repository Context** - Existing patterns, utilities, architectural conventions
2. **Technical Stack Context** - Dependencies, frameworks, language idioms, tooling
3. **Domain Context** - Business logic, existing data models, domain constraints
4. **Quality Context** - Testing approaches, code standards, performance requirements
5. **Environmental Context** - Build systems, deployment constraints, infrastructure

## Key Distinctions

**Abstraction Levels:**
- Sequential and hierarchical
- Progress from "what" to "how"
- Enable progressive refinement

**Context Types:**
- Parallel and orthogonal
- Required across multiple abstraction levels
- Represent external dependencies
- Enable informed decision-making

## Definitive Patterns
**High Confidence Mappings:**
- Business Requirements: Always Domain, often Environmental
- Code Implementation: Always Repository, always Technical Stack
- Quality Context: Spans levels 4-7 consistently

**Gradient Patterns:**
- Domain Context: Heavy at levels 1-3, lightens toward implementation
- Repository Context: Light at levels 1-2, heavy at levels 5-7
- Technical Stack: Emerges at level 2, peaks at levels 6-7

## The Progressive Constraint Model
- Each level inherits constraints from above
- Each level adds new constraints below
- Context provides the knowledge to set appropriate constraints

## Completeness
All implementation requirements fit into these categories: either as a refinement step (abstraction level) or as external knowledge (context type).
