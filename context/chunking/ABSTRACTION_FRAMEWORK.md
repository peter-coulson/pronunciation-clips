# Implementation Specification Framework

## Problem Statement

**System Context**: Stateless agents with document handoffs performing universal, project-agnostic specification transformation.

### Planning Module Goal 
The planning module performs bi-directional specification transformation: 
1. **Quality Assessment** - evaluating input specifications for completeness, coherence, feasibility, and alignment across all relevant knowledge domains, with capability to reject insufficient inputs or request refinements.
2. **Specification Progression** - transforming validated input specifications from lower to higher specification levels while systematically integrating available knowledge domains. 

### Success Criteria
Perfect planning occurs when the module produces output specifications that meet sufficiency thresholds for downstream execution while ensuring the underlying specification quality enables system changes that satisfy all dimensional requirements.

## Core Dimensions

### Specification Levels (How Detailed Should My New Implementation Be?)
Sequential refinement from business intent to executable code - defines the TARGET granularity for new specifications:

1. **Requirements Level** - What the system should accomplish from user/stakeholder perspective
2. **Architecture Level** - Component relationships, data flows, system structure
3. **Interface Level** - Module boundaries, data schemas, component contracts
4. **Behavior Level** - Test cases, expected behaviors, error conditions
5. **Strategy Level** - Algorithms, internal logic flows, design patterns
6. **Signature Level** - Exact method contracts, parameters, return types
7. **Implementation Level** - Actual syntax, variable names, implementation details

### Knowledge Requirements Framework
This framework generates context requirements for any change by mapping universal risk patterns to specific project contexts. Requirements are determined dynamically based on specification level and risk prevention needs.

#### Universal Risk Types
- **System-Breaking**: Violates fundamental constraints causing failures
- **Integration-Breaking**: Prevents components from working together  
- **Maintenance-Breaking**: Creates technical debt blocking future changes
- **Quality-Breaking**: Violates established standards causing degradation

#### Universal Knowledge Categories
- **Constraint Knowledge**: "What boundaries cannot be crossed?"
- **Pattern Knowledge**: "What are established ways of doing things?"
- **Integration Knowledge**: "How do components connect/communicate?"
- **Convention Knowledge**: "What are consistency requirements?"

#### Risk-Knowledge Mapping
- **Constraint Knowledge** → Prevents System-Breaking risks
- **Pattern Knowledge** → Prevents Maintenance-Breaking risks  
- **Integration Knowledge** → Prevents Integration-Breaking risks
- **Convention Knowledge** → Prevents Quality-Breaking risks

#### Context Independence Progression
- **Infrastructure Knowledge**: Context-independent after Architecture Level
- **Domain Knowledge**: Context-independent after Behavior Level  
- **Technology/Quality/Codebase Knowledge**: Remain critical through Implementation Level

This framework enables intelligent systems to generate optimal context requirements for any change by determining which knowledge categories are critical at each specification level to prevent unacceptable risks.
