# Implementation Specification Framework

## Problem Statement

### Planning Module Goal 
The planning module performs bi-directional specification transformation: 
1. **Quality Assessment** - evaluating input specifications for completeness, coherence, feasibility, and alignment across all relevant knowledge domains, with capability to reject insufficient inputs or request refinements.
2. **Specification Progression** - transforming validated input specifications from lower to higher specification levels while systematically integrating available knowledge domains. 

### Success Criteria
Perfect planning occurs when the module produces output specifications that meet sufficiency thresholds for downstream execution while ensuring the underlying specification quality enables system changes that satisfy all dimensional requirements.

## Core Dimensions

### Specification Levels (How Detailed Should My New Implementation Be?)
Sequential refinement from business intent to executable code - defines the TARGET granularity for new specifications:

1. **Requirements Level** - What the system should accomplish from user/stakeholder perspective
2. **Architecture Level** - Component relationships, data flows, system structure
3. **Interface Level** - Module boundaries, data schemas, component contracts
4. **Behavior Level** - Test cases, expected behaviors, error conditions
5. **Strategy Level** - Algorithms, internal logic flows, design patterns
6. **Signature Level** - Exact method contracts, parameters, return types
7. **Implementation Level** - Actual syntax, variable names, implementation details

### Knowledge Domains (What Do I Already Know About The Existing System?)
Orthogonal categories of existing system knowledge that inform decisions at any specification level:

1. **Codebase Knowledge** - Existing patterns, utilities, architectural conventions, code organization
2. **Technology Knowledge** - Dependencies, frameworks, language idioms, tooling, libraries
3. **Domain Knowledge** - Business logic, existing data models, domain constraints, business rules
4. **Quality Standards** - Testing approaches, code standards, performance requirements, validation patterns
5. **Infrastructure Knowledge** - Build systems, deployment constraints, environment configuration

### Knowledge Categorization Strategy
Knowledge domain requirements are determined by **critical thresholds** at each specification level:

- **Risk-Based Criticality** - Knowledge is critical if its absence creates unacceptable risk (system breaking, integration breaking, maintenance breaking, or quality breaking)
- **Context Sufficiency** - Each domain reaches a sufficiency threshold where additional system context becomes counterproductive
- **Context Independence** - Beyond sufficiency thresholds, implementation relies on universal engineering principles rather than system-specific knowledge
- **Best Practices as Critical** - Development patterns and practices are treated as critical at their natural enforcement level (e.g., architectural patterns critical at Architecture Level, coding conventions critical at Implementation Level)

For each specification level, determine: "What knowledge from each domain is CRITICAL to prevent unacceptable risk?"
