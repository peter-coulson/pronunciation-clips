# Test Generation Module

## Overview
Stateless agent system for transforming Level 4 test specifications and testing context into executable test implementations.

## Input Files

### From Planning Module
- **LEVEL_4_E2E_TEST_SPECIFICATION.md** - Immutable E2E test contracts
  - Contains: Method signatures, validation targets, test fixtures, success assertions, performance thresholds, error test signatures, test data schemas
  - When filled: Concrete test method names, specific assertion patterns, actual fixture file references, measurable performance limits

- **LEVEL_4_INTEGRATION_TEST_SPECIFICATION.md** - Immutable integration test contracts  
  - Contains: Integration test methods, mock signatures, data flow tests, error integration signatures, contract validation signatures, state consistency tests
  - When filled: Specific component integration scenarios, concrete mock implementations, actual data flow validation patterns, real contract schemas

### From Chunking Division Module
- **TEST_CONTEXT_TEMPLATE.md** - Testing infrastructure context
  - Contains: Testing framework constraints, infrastructure patterns, quality standards, existing test analysis, development integration patterns
  - When filled: Actual framework versions, concrete test organization patterns, specific commands and configurations, real fixture strategies, current test file locations and patterns

## Output Goal

### Primary Objective
Transform immutable test specifications into executable, project-consistent test implementations that validate system behavior at both E2E and integration levels.

### Success Criteria
- **Executable Tests**: All generated tests run successfully in the target environment
- **Pattern Consistency**: Generated tests follow established project testing patterns and conventions
- **Specification Compliance**: All test assertions validate the exact behaviors specified in Level 4 contracts
- **Infrastructure Integration**: Tests integrate seamlessly with existing CI/CD, development workflows, and debugging tools
- **Immutability Respect**: No modifications to original test specifications during implementation

### Output Artifacts
- **Executable E2E Test Files**: Complete test implementations for end-to-end validation
- **Executable Integration Test Files**: Complete test implementations for component boundary validation  
- **Test Support Files**: Fixtures, mocks, and helper utilities required for test execution
- **Configuration Files**: Test-specific configuration aligned with project infrastructure

## Agent Constraints
- **Stateless Operation**: Each test generation operates independently without persistent state
- **Specification Immutability**: Cannot modify input test specifications under any circumstances
- **Context Dependency**: Must respect all infrastructure constraints and patterns from test context
- **Quality Compliance**: Generated tests must meet all specified coverage and performance standards

## Integration Points
- **Planning Module**: Consumes immutable test specifications as requirements
- **Chunking Division**: Consumes testing context for implementation guidance  
- **Execution Module**: Provides executable tests for chunk validation and module completion
