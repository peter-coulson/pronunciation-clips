# Agent-Based Chunking System - Implementation Planning

## Implementation Priority Order

1. **Template Specification Standards** - Communication backbone; agents cannot coordinate without standardized formats
2. **Methodology to Prompt Translation** - Agent decision-making capabilities; bridges workflow rules to executable instructions  
3. **Phase B Implementation (Module Decomposition)** - Core chunking analysis; requires templates and prompts to function effectively

## What Has Been Defined

- **Core workflow structure**: Two-phase execution with specialized agents and document-based coordination
- **Scale boundaries**: 4-25 chunk system with proven experimental effectiveness metrics
- **Testing foundation**: E2E test immutability and sequential validation requirements
- **Architecture constraints**: Stateless agent design aligned with Task tool limitations

## What Is Yet To Be Defined

### **CRITICAL FOR MVP** (Required Upfront)

#### **Core Communication & Coordination**
- **Template specification standards**: Input specification, handoff document, context package, summary report formats
- **Handoff document implementation**: Concrete standards beyond reference examples
- **Methodology to prompt translation**: How workflow rules get encoded into actual agent instruction files
- **Control and Sub-Agent behaviors**: Specific decision-making prompts and communication patterns

#### **Essential Workflow Components**
- **Phase B implementation**: Module decomposition techniques and boundary decision patterns
- **Interface contract specifications**: Detailed input/output relationship definitions with validation criteria
- **Dependency mapping protocols**: Sequential execution order determination methods
- **Test specification placement**: Where unit, integration, and chunk-level E2E tests are defined and managed
- **Main Agent coordination details**: Process orchestration, report interpretation, and error recovery implementation

#### **Basic System Operations**
- **Session lifecycle management**: Creation, execution, archival, and reference workflows within context system
- **Failure handling mechanisms**: Basic recovery procedures, restart vs escalation decision criteria

#### **Quality Gates***
- **Input specification validation**: Completeness criteria and gap identification procedures*
- **Template validation protocols**: Quality gates and validation procedures for communication backbone*

*Can start with manual review for MVP
