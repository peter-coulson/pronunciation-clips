# Stage 2: Planning Coordination

## Execution Logic
Sequential execution of two independent phases that transform requirements into implementation specifications through Level 4.

## Planning Flow

### Phase 1: Architecture-Interface Design
**Inputs**: 
- REQUIREMENTS_LEVEL_INPUT.md
- CONTEXT_EXTRACTION_OUTPUT.md

**Process**: Transform requirements into system architecture and interface specifications
**Outputs**: 
- Level 2 Architecture Specification
- Level 3 Interface Specification

**Failure Handling**: If Phase 1 fails, halt entire Stage 2 execution and raise issue to user.

### Phase 2: Behavior-Specification Design
**Inputs**:
- REQUIREMENTS_LEVEL_INPUT.md (original)
- CONTEXT_EXTRACTION_OUTPUT.md (original)
- Level 2 Architecture Specification (from Phase 1)
- Level 3 Interface Specification (from Phase 1)

**Process**: Transform architecture and interface specifications into behavioral requirements and test specifications
**Outputs**:
- Level 4 Behavior Specification
- Level 4 E2E Test Specification  
- Level 4 Integration Test Specification

## Context Handoffs
**Template Location**: Each phase outputs standardized templates
**Handoff Method**: Phase 2 reads completed templates from Phase 1 outputs

## Coordination Responsibilities
1. Execute architecture-interface design first
2. Verify Phase 1 completion before proceeding
3. Execute behavior-specification design second
4. Provide template locations to phases
5. Handle execution failures by stopping and reporting to user

**Note**: Phases operate entirely independently - coordination layer only manages execution sequence and template handoffs.
