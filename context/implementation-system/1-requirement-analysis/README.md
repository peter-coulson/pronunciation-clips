# Stage 1: Requirements

## Purpose

**Knowledge Requirements Determination and Aggregation**

This stage determines what knowledge is required for a proposed change and aggregates all required knowledge from the knowledge repository, detailing where any specifications are missing.

## Key Benefits

**Prevalidation**: Ensures knowledge completeness before future stages begin work, enabling strict standard enforcement and no-assumptions policy

**Knowledge Packaging**: Outputs well-referenced knowledge package so future stages don't need to search repository knowledge

**Standard Enforcement**: Forces users to pre-specify standards, improving planning quality

**Standalone Planning Tool**: Can be used independently outside implementation system to determine critical project standards before development begins

## Stage Scope

**Responsibilities**:
- Define which specifications are required for proposed changes
- Aggregate knowledge from knowledge repository using knowledge requirements framework
- Document missing specifications and knowledge gaps

**Boundaries**: 
- Does NOT generate concrete specifications (that's Stage 2's role)
- Currently configured for single template (USER_REQUIREMENTS_TEMPLATE.md) - expansion to multiple templates should be straightforward with configuration layer
- Knowledge repository agnostic - functions with any well-structured knowledge repository

## Usage

**Primary Input**: USER_REQUIREMENTS_TEMPLATE.md (currently configured template)
**Critical Requirement**: Minimal System Information sections must be complete (Technical Overview, Integration Landscape, Quality Standards)

**Template Quality**: High-quality template filling is essential for stage and wider system functioning

**Invocation**: Easily invokable with properly filled template as input

## Success Criteria

- All sub-process processes execute correctly
- All output templates filled completely 
- Missing knowledge clearly documented with specific gaps identified
- Knowledge repository sources properly referenced

## Future Expansion

Stage designed for repository agnostic operation. Currently configured for single template but designed for easy expansion to support multiple templates at various scales through configuration layer. Would require defining validation rules, field mappings, and output formats per template type.
