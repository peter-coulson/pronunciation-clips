# Phase 1: Implementation Segmentation & Dependency Analysis Methodology

## Objective
Transform Level 4 Behavior Specification into execution-ready segment boundaries with dependency sequencing using Interface-Driven Boundaries with Functional Cohesion.

## Input Requirements
- **Level 4 Behavior Specification** (Primary)
- **Level 3 Interface Specification** (Boundary reference)  
- **Level 2 Architecture Specification** (System context)
- **Context Extraction Output** (Complexity assessment)

*Specification levels defined in @ABSTRACTION_FRAMEWORK.md*

## Process Steps

### Step 1: Interface Boundary Mapping
Extract interface contracts from Level 3 specification that represent natural system boundaries where segment handoffs can occur cleanly.

### Step 2: Behavioral Clustering with Dependencies
Group related Level 4 behaviors by functional cohesion while analyzing behavioral dependencies within each interface boundary area.

### Step 3: Context Estimation & Dependency Optimization
Estimate context requirements and adjust boundaries to optimize dependency flow and parallel execution opportunities.

### Step 4: Execution Sequencing
Define segment execution sequence, parallel execution groups, and critical path based on dependency analysis.

### Step 5: Integrated Validation
Validate segment definitions for interface completeness, context limits, dependency efficiency, and execution feasibility.

## Methodology Principles
1. **Interface Primacy**: Segment boundaries align with Level 3 interface contracts
2. **Functional Cohesion**: Behaviors within segments are functionally related
3. **Context Constraints**: No segment exceeds 3K token context limit
4. **Dependency Optimization**: Segment boundaries optimize execution flow
5. **Parallel Maximization**: Enable maximum parallel execution opportunities

## Output
**SEGMENTATION_ANALYSIS_TEMPLATE.md** containing optimized segment boundaries, execution sequence, and parallel execution groups ready for implementation specification extraction.

## Success Criteria  
- All Level 4 behaviors assigned to execution-optimized segments
- Execution sequence with parallel opportunities identified
- Critical path and completion estimates established
