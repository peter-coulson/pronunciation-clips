# Stage 3: Execution Preparation

## Purpose

Transforms comprehensive system planning into execution-ready implementation packages. Takes level 1-4 specifications, testing requirements, and repository context as inputs and produces small, focused units of 3K token context instructions that can be independently executed by the implementation stage, plus consolidated testing standards context to enforce repository quality standards.

## Core Transformation Process

The stage performs two primary breakdowns:

1. **Planning Decomposition**: Splits level 4 behavioral specifications into manageable, dependency-optimized units using implementation segmentation
2. **Context Division**: Divides planning context and repository context into focused, executable packages with appropriate knowledge filtering

## Sub-Process Structure

### Phase 1: Implementation Segmentation
**Directory**: `implementation-segmentation/`
**Focus**: Interface-driven boundaries with functional cohesion
- Transforms behavioral specifications into execution-optimized unit boundaries
- Analyzes dependencies and establishes execution sequencing
- Identifies parallel execution opportunities

### Phase 2: Context Scoping  
**Directory**: `context-scoping/`
**Focus**: Knowledge context division
- Extracts system-wide testing context for implementation standards
- Creates implementation-ready context templates for each unit
- Applies filtered repository knowledge to prevent integration risks

### Phase 3: Execution Orchestration
**Directory**: `execution-orchestration/`
**Focus**: Template population synthesis
- Integrates implementation segmentation and context scoping outputs
- Produces final coordination plan for implementation execution
- Establishes handoff specifications and completion criteria

## Input Summary

Receives system specifications and repository context from Stage 2 (Planning). See individual sub-process methodologies for detailed input requirements.

## Output Summary

Produces execution coordination plan and unit-specific context templates for Stage 4 (Implementation). See individual sub-process methodologies for detailed output specifications.

## Operational Flow

Sequential execution through three phases with document-based handoffs. See `coordination.md` for execution logic and sub-process orchestration details.
