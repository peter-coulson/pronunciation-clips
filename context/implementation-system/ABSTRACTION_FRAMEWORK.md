# Implementation Specification Framework

## Terminology Clarification

**IMPORTANT**: This system uses precise terminology to avoid confusion with broader project concepts:

- **Knowledge Repository**: External storage of project information (e.g., Claude's project context folders, documentation systems)
- **Knowledge**: Information and data extracted from repositories 
- **Scope**: Boundaries and filtering of information for specific purposes
- **Context**: Execution environment only (e.g., testing context, runtime context)

*This distinguishes internal system processing from external "project context" storage systems.*

## Core Dimensions

### Specification Levels (How Detailed Should My New Implementation Be?)
Sequential refinement from business intent to executable code - defines the TARGET granularity for new specifications:

1. **Requirements Level** - What the system should accomplish from user/stakeholder perspective
2. **Architecture Level** - Component relationships, data flows, system structure
3. **Interface Level** - Module boundaries, data schemas, component contracts
4. **Behavior Level** - Test cases, expected behaviors, error conditions
5. **Strategy Level** - Algorithms, internal logic flows, design patterns
6. **Signature Level** - Exact method contracts, parameters, return types
7. **Implementation Level** - Actual syntax, variable names, implementation details

### Knowledge Requirements Framework
This framework generates knowledge requirements for any change by mapping universal risk patterns to specific project knowledge. Requirements are determined dynamically based on specification level and risk prevention needs.

#### Universal Risk Types
- **System-Breaking**: Violates fundamental constraints causing failures
- **Integration-Breaking**: Prevents components from working together  
- **Maintenance-Breaking**: Creates technical debt blocking future changes
- **Quality-Breaking**: Violates established standards causing degradation

#### Universal Knowledge Categories
- **Constraint Knowledge**: "What boundaries cannot be crossed?"
- **Pattern Knowledge**: "What are established ways of doing things?"
- **Integration Knowledge**: "How do components connect/communicate?"
- **Convention Knowledge**: "What are consistency requirements?"

#### Risk-Knowledge Mapping
- **Constraint Knowledge** → Prevents System-Breaking risks
- **Pattern Knowledge** → Prevents Maintenance-Breaking risks  
- **Integration Knowledge** → Prevents Integration-Breaking risks
- **Convention Knowledge** → Prevents Quality-Breaking risks

#### Knowledge Independence Progression
- **Infrastructure Knowledge**: Knowledge-independent after Architecture Level
- **Domain Knowledge**: Knowledge-independent after Behavior Level  
- **Technology/Quality/Codebase Knowledge**: Remain critical through Implementation Level

This framework enables intelligent systems to generate optimal knowledge requirements for any change by determining which knowledge categories are critical at each specification level to prevent unacceptable risks.
