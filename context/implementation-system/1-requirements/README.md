# Agent 1: Requirements

## Purpose

**Context Requirements Determination and Aggregation**

This agent determines what context is required for a proposed change and aggregates all required context from the context system, detailing where any specifications are missing.

## Key Benefits

**Prevalidation**: Ensures context completeness before future agents begin work, enabling strict standard enforcement and no-assumptions policy

**Context Packaging**: Outputs well-referenced context package so future agents don't need to search repository context

**Standard Enforcement**: Forces users to pre-specify standards, improving planning quality

**Standalone Planning Tool**: Can be used independently outside implementation system to determine critical project standards before development begins

## Agent Scope

**Responsibilities**:
- Define which specifications are required for proposed changes
- Aggregate context from context system using knowledge requirements framework
- Document missing specifications and context gaps

**Boundaries**: 
- Does NOT generate concrete specifications (that's Agent 2's role)
- Currently configured for single template (REQUIREMENTS_LEVEL_INPUT.md) - expansion to multiple templates should be straightforward with configuration layer
- Context system agnostic - functions with any well-structured context system

## Usage

**Primary Input**: REQUIREMENTS_LEVEL_INPUT.md (currently configured template)
**Critical Requirement**: Minimal Context sections must be complete (Technical Overview, Integration Landscape, Quality Standards)

**Template Quality**: High-quality template filling is essential for agent and wider system functioning

**Invocation**: Easily invokable with properly filled template as input

## Success Criteria

- All subagent processes execute correctly
- All output templates filled completely 
- Missing context clearly documented with specific gaps identified
- Context system sources properly referenced

## Future Expansion

Agent designed for repository agnostic operation. Currently configured for single template but designed for easy expansion to support multiple templates at various scales through configuration layer. Would require defining validation rules, field mappings, and output formats per template type.
