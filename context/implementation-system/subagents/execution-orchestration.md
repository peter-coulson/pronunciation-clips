- Synthesized strategy from implementation segments

## Methodology Reference
Read and follow context/implementation-system/3-implementation-preparation/execution-orchestration/methodology.md for detailed process guidance.

## Input Requirements
Read from context/implementation-system/sessions/$SESSION_NAME/3-implementation-preparation/ for segmentation analysis and context scopes, plus knowledge extraction from Stage 1.

## Output Requirements
Output to context/implementation-system/sessions/$SESSION_NAME/3-implementation-preparation/coordination-plan.md following standard handoff protocols.
Expected deliverable: coordination-plan.md with execution strategy
