# Context Gathering Methodology

## Universal 3-Stage Process

### Stage 1: Identify Context Requirements
#### Purpose  
Identify and document exactly what patterns and domain knowledge the agent needs to complete its core task. Creates a concrete requirements specification that prevents assumptions and guides targeted context loading.

### Stage 2: Load Required Context
#### Purpose
Systematically search for context that addresses the context requirements. 

### Stage 3: Complete Output with Integrated Validation
#### Purpose
Execute the core task using loaded context and validate output completeness in a single integrated process. Ensures quality while eliminating redundant validation steps.
