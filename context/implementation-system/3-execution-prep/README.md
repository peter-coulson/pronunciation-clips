# Agent 3: Execution Preparation

## Purpose

Transforms comprehensive system planning into execution-ready implementation packages. Takes level 1-4 specifications, testing requirements, and repository context as inputs and produces small, focused units of 3K token context instructions that can be independently executed by the implementation agent, plus consolidated testing standards context to enforce repository quality standards.

## Core Transformation Process

The agent performs two primary breakdowns:

1. **Planning Decomposition**: Splits level 4 behavioral specifications into manageable, dependency-optimized units
2. **Context Division**: Divides planning context and repository context into focused, executable packages with appropriate knowledge filtering

## Sub-Agent Structure

### Phase 1: Boundary Analysis
**Directory**: `boundary-analysis/`
**Focus**: Interface-driven boundaries with functional cohesion
- Transforms behavioral specifications into execution-optimized unit boundaries
- Analyzes dependencies and establishes execution sequencing
- Identifies parallel execution opportunities

### Phase 2: Context Filtering  
**Directory**: `context-filtering/`
**Focus**: Knowledge context division
- Extracts system-wide testing context for implementation standards
- Creates implementation-ready context templates for each unit
- Applies filtered repository knowledge to prevent integration risks

### Phase 3: Coordination Synthesis
**Directory**: `coordination-synthesis/`
**Focus**: Template population synthesis
- Integrates boundary analysis and context filtering outputs
- Produces final coordination plan for implementation execution
- Establishes handoff specifications and completion criteria

## Input Summary

Receives system specifications and repository context from Agent 2 (Planning). See individual sub-agent methodologies for detailed input requirements.

## Output Summary

Produces execution coordination plan and unit-specific context templates for Agent 4 (Implementation). See individual sub-agent methodologies for detailed output specifications.

## Operational Flow

Sequential execution through three phases with document-based handoffs. See `coordination.md` for execution logic and sub-agent orchestration details.
