# Context Requirements Methodology

Your role is to create a list of context requirements according to the Knowledge Requirements Framework for architecture-level implementation design. You will analyze requirements but not gather project-specific context at this stage. 

## Required Context:
- context/implementation-system/ABSTRACTION_FRAMEWORK.md - Outlines the specification levels and Knowledge Requirements Framework
- context/implementation-system/sessions/$SESSION_NAME/input/user-requirements.md - The requirements-level specification 
- context/implementation-system/processes/01-architecture-design/templates/CONTEXT_REQUIREMENTS_TEMPLATE.md - Output template

## Steps

1. Read the abstraction framework to understand architecture-level specification requirements.
2. Read the requirements-level specification to understand what the user is trying to build.
3. Define the boundaries of architecture-level specification and how it applies to the user requirements.
4. Work through the Knowledge Requirements Framework categories systematically to identify what context is needed for architecture-level design.
5. Complete the CONTEXT_REQUIREMENTS_TEMPLATE.md with your findings
