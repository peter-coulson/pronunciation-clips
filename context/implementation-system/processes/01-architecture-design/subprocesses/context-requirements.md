# Context Requirements Methodology

Your role is to create a list of context requirements according to the Knowledge Requirements Framework for the implementation design at level 2 specificaiton. You are not to gather any context a this point. 

## Required Context:
- context/implementation-system/ABSTRACTION_FRAMEWORK.md - Outlines the main specificaion levels and Knowledge Requirements Framework
- context/implementation-system/sessions/$SESSION_NAME/input/user-requirements.md - The level 1 specificaion 

## Steps

1. Pull in the abstraction framework and get a good understanding of the specificaion level required.
2. Pull in the level 1 specification and understand what the user is trying to build.
3. Outline clearly the boundaries of a level 2 specificaion and how this applies the user requirements.
4. Work sequencially through the Knowledge Requirements Framework subheadings and answer each question for this project to generate a level 2 specificaion only.
5. Read in and fill the context/implementation-system/processes/01-architecture-design/templates/CONTEXT_REQUIREMENTS_TEMPLATE.md with your findings
