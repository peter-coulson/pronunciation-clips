# Stage-Based Implementation System Development

## ⚠️ CRITICAL CONTEXT WARNING ⚠️
**ALWAYS question whether context is absolutely necessary within this file.**
- Keep context as concise as possible
- If you're adding context, ask yourself: "Is this essential for the current development task?"
- **When in doubt, leave it out**

## Current Phase: System Development
We are currently **developing** the 4-stage implementation system. Not operationally ready.

**Note**: The `sessions/` folder structure exists but stages are not ready for operational use.

## Development Standards
- Always read necessary methodology files before implementing new components
- Follow single responsibility principle for methodology content division
- Adhere to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle to minimize redundancy

## Abstraction Framework
@ABSTRACTION_FRAMEWORK.md defines the core specification transformation logic:
- **Specification Levels**: 7-level progression from requirements to implementation
- **Knowledge Requirements Framework**: Maps universal risk types to knowledge categories
- **Knowledge Independence**: Determines when knowledge becomes context-independent
This framework drives the planning module's bi-directional specification transformation.

## Project Structure  
@README.md - Complete system documentation and directory structure

## Terminology
@TERMINOLOGY.md - Defines core system concepts, process structure, and information management terms.

## Critical Constraints
- Isolated stage processing (Task tool limitations)
- Document-based handoffs only
- Sequential execution (no parallel coordination)
- Repository agnostic design
