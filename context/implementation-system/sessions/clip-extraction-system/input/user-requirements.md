# Requirements Level Input Template

## Feature Overview
**Feature Name**: Pronunciation Clip Extraction System

**Problem Statement**: 
Current audio-to-JSON pipeline produces complete word databases but lacks clip extraction capability. This creates a critical gap between transcription output and practical pronunciation training requirements, as learners cannot access isolated audio segments for focused practice.

**User Perspective**: 
Language learners require a two-step workflow: search for candidate pronunciation clips using text and quality criteria, then select and extract chosen clips by referencing their database identifiers. They need comprehensive search results with quality indicators for decision-making, followed by extracted audio files with metadata for external system integration.

**Integration Context**: 
Extends existing audio-to-JSON pipeline by adding clip extraction and search capabilities. Maintains database integrity while adding clip tracking. Enables future integration with external tools and supports future expansion to word sequence extraction without system redesign.

## Functional Requirements

### Primary Functionality
- Search databases to return candidate word clips with quality indicators and selection identifiers
- Extract user-selected clips by identifier reference and provide audio files with integration metadata
- Track extraction status to prevent storage duplication while preserving speaker/context variations
- Support comprehensive accent training through multiple instances from different speakers and contexts

### Secondary Functionality
- Search by text content, quality metrics, and speaker identification across multiple database files
- Enable batch selection and processing of multiple clips simultaneously
- Design system to support future word sequence extraction (multi-word phrases) without architectural changes
- Provide extensible search and selection framework for expanding functionality

## Success Criteria

### Functional Success Metrics
- [ ] Two-step workflow: search returns candidates with identifiers, extraction processes user selections by identifier
- [ ] Search results include text content, quality indicators, speaker identification, and unique selection identifiers
- [ ] Extraction results provide audio files with metadata suitable for external system integration
- [ ] System prevents storing duplicate clips while encouraging multiple speaker/context variations for comprehensive training

### Quality Success Metrics  
- [ ] Audio clips maintain pronunciation practice quality with accurate word boundaries
- [ ] System processes requests efficiently without excessive resource consumption
- [ ] Extracted clips meet language learning requirements for duration and audio quality
- [ ] Database operations maintain data integrity throughout search and extraction processes

### User Experience Success Metrics
- [ ] Search operations return clear, actionable results enabling informed user selection decisions
- [ ] Output format supports integration with external learning tools and systems
- [ ] System design accommodates future expansion to word sequence extraction without major changes

## Constraints and Non-Functional Requirements

### Technical Constraints
- **Performance**: System must process requests efficiently for practical language learning use
- **Dependencies**: Build upon existing transcription and speaker identification capabilities
- **Platform**: Maintain local processing approach with consideration for future API integration

### Business Constraints
- **Timeline**: Prioritize extensible design to support future word sequence functionality without system redesign
- **Risk Tolerance**: Emphasize robust, maintainable architecture over rapid feature delivery

### Integration Constraints
- **Backward Compatibility**: Preserve existing database functionality while adding clip extraction capabilities
- **Breaking Changes**: Limit changes to additive enhancements that don't disrupt current workflows
- **Future Expansion**: Enable word sequence extraction capability (multi-word phrases like "the cat in the hat") through unified search and selection approach

## Minimum System Information for Knowledge Requirements Generation

### Technical Overview
- **Primary Technologies**: Python 3.9+, Pydantic validation, YAML configuration, Click CLI framework
- **System Architecture**: Function-based pipeline with database integration and structured processing
- **Deployment Environment**: Local macOS/Linux systems with optional GPU acceleration

### Integration Landscape  
- **External Dependencies**: faster-whisper transcription, PyAnnote diarization, librosa audio processing, pytest testing
- **Communication Patterns**: File system operations for audio and database files, structured data processing

### Quality Standards
- **Existing Standards**: Pydantic validation, comprehensive testing coverage, configuration management
- **Architecture Principles**: Data integrity maintenance, extensible design patterns, robust error handling

## Additional Information

### User Workflow Definition
**Search Step**: User enters search criteria (e.g., word "cat" with specific speaker preferences) and system returns all matching instances with unique identifiers and quality indicators for selection.

**Selection Step**: User references specific instances by their identifiers (e.g., selecting items 3, 7, and 12 from search results) for extraction processing.

### Duplication vs Variation Definitions
**Variations (Encouraged)**: Multiple instances of the same word from different speakers, audio sources, or contextual settings - these provide comprehensive accent training opportunities.

**Duplications (Prevented)**: Identical audio clips stored multiple times - if the exact same word instance from the same audio source and context is selected repeatedly, only one copy should be stored.

### Future Word Sequence Support
System must accommodate future expansion to handle multi-word phrases (e.g., "the cat in the hat") using the same search-and-select approach. Word sequences will be identified by word range references and follow identical duplication prevention rules - same sequence from same source equals duplication, same sequence from different sources equals beneficial variation.
