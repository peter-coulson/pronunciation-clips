# Level 4 Behavior Specification

## Session Information
- **Session Name**: clip-extraction-system
- **Feature Name**: Pronunciation Clip Extraction System
- **Specification Level**: Level 4 (Behavior Level)
- **Behavior Date**: 2025-09-03
- **Previous Level**: Interface Level (component contracts defined)
- **Next Level**: Strategy Level (algorithm implementations)

## Behavioral Specification Purpose

Define comprehensive behavioral requirements and test specifications that transform interface contracts into observable, testable behaviors. This specification establishes immutable behavioral contracts that prevent scope drift and ensure complete system coverage.

### Behavioral Design Principles
- **Observable Behaviors**: All behaviors must be externally observable and testable
- **Complete Coverage**: Every interface method must have defined behaviors for normal, edge, and error cases
- **Behavioral Immutability**: Once defined, behaviors form immutable contracts for implementation
- **Colombian Spanish Focus**: All audio processing behaviors account for Colombian Spanish linguistic characteristics
