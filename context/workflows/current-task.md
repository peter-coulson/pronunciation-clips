# Current Task Context

## Active Work
**Task**: Context System Implementation  
**Stage**: Foundation Setup  
**Priority**: High  

## Objectives
- [✓] Read claude_code_development_framework.md
- [✓] Update CLAUDE.md to lightweight router format
- [✓] Create /context/ directory structure
- [IN PROGRESS] Migrate detailed content to appropriate context files
- [PENDING] Set up initial stage contexts

## Next Steps
- Complete context file population
- Create stage1-foundation.md
- Set up reference files (apis, configs, troubleshooting)

## Notes
- Framework emphasizes token efficiency through progressive context loading
- CLAUDE.md now serves as navigation hub rather than comprehensive documentation
- Context system will improve development efficiency and maintainability
