# Current Task Context

## Active Work
**Task**: Context System Implementation Complete  
**Stage**: Foundation Setup  
**Priority**: High  

## Completed Objectives
- [✓] Read claude_code_development_framework.md
- [✓] Update CLAUDE.md to lightweight router format (29 lines vs 72 lines)
- [✓] Create /context/ directory structure with 4 domains
- [✓] Migrate detailed content to appropriate context files
- [✓] Populate architecture.md with actual implementation details  
- [✓] Populate data.md with Pydantic models and Colombian Spanish requirements
- [✓] Create stage contexts for stages 1, 2, 6, and 8
- [✓] Analyze actual src/ implementation and implementation.md
- [✓] Update testing.md with comprehensive test suite details (28 test files)

## System Status
**Implementation Status**: All 8 stages implemented and operational
**Testing Status**: Complete 3-layer test suite (28 total test files)
- ✅ Stage 1: Foundation (config, models, logging, exceptions)
- ✅ Stage 2: Audio Processing (format handling, validation)  
- ✅ Stage 3: Transcription (Whisper integration)
- ✅ Stage 4: Entity Creation (word-to-entity conversion)
- ✅ Stage 5: Database Writing (atomic JSON operations)
- ✅ Stage 6: Pipeline Integration (full workflow orchestration)
- ✅ Stage 7: Speaker Integration (speaker mapping)
- ✅ Stage 8: CLI Interface (Click-based user interface)

## Context System Benefits Achieved
- **Token efficiency**: Context files load only when needed
- **Domain separation**: Architecture, data, testing, standards in separate files
- **Progressive disclosure**: Detailed implementation context available on demand
- **Navigation hub**: CLAUDE.md serves as lightweight entry point
- **Stage-specific context**: Detailed context for each implementation stage

## Architecture Insights Captured
- **Pydantic-based models**: Full type safety with validation
- **Smart buffering**: Colombian Spanish zero-gap detection implemented
- **Configuration system**: YAML + environment variable overrides
- **Error hierarchy**: PipelineError-based exception system
- **CLI integration**: Click framework with progress feedback

## Test Infrastructure Complete
- **Unit Tests**: 10 files for component isolation testing
- **Integration Tests**: 7 files for stage interaction testing  
- **E2E Tests**: 8 files for complete workflow validation
- **Test Fixtures**: 6 real Spanish audio files + optimized configuration
- **Shared Infrastructure**: conftest.py with comprehensive fixtures and utilities

## Next Development Phases
System is ready for:
1. **New feature development** using established patterns
2. **Performance optimization** using captured metrics
3. **Module 2 implementation** (JSON → Clips pipeline)
4. **Production deployment** with comprehensive test coverage
