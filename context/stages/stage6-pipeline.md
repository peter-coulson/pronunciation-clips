# Stage 6: Full Pipeline Integration

## Deliverables  
- `audio_to_json/pipeline.py` - Complete audio-to-JSON pipeline orchestration

## Implementation Status
✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - Full pipeline with smart buffering complete

## Success Criteria

### End-to-End Tests (ALL MUST PASS)
1. **Complete Audio-to-JSON Pipeline**
   - Process real Spanish audio file end-to-end
   - Verify output JSON contains expected word count (±20%)
   - Verify all entities have valid timestamps and confidence scores
   - Verify processing completes within reasonable time

2. **Resumability**
   - Stop pipeline after transcription stage
   - Resume from transcription and complete successfully
   - Verify intermediate files created and used correctly

3. **Error Handling**
   - Graceful failure on invalid audio file
   - Graceful failure on Whisper model loading error
   - Proper error logging and cleanup

## Pipeline Stages Integration
1. **Audio Processing**: Format validation, metadata extraction, resampling  
2. **Transcription**: Whisper-based speech recognition with word timestamps
3. **Entity Creation**: Convert words to typed entities with quality filtering
4. **Database Creation**: Assemble complete WordDatabase with metadata
5. **Smart Buffering**: Colombian Spanish zero-gap detection and buffering
6. **Database Writing**: Atomic JSON file operations with backup

## Critical Implementation: Smart Buffering
```python
def _apply_smart_buffering(self, database: WordDatabase) -> WordDatabase:
    """Apply smart buffering for Colombian Spanish continuous speech."""
    sorted_entities = sorted(database.entities, key=lambda e: e.start_time)
    
    zero_gap_count = 0
    for i in range(len(sorted_entities) - 1):
        current = sorted_entities[i]
        next_entity = sorted_entities[i + 1]
        
        # Check for zero gap (Colombian Spanish characteristic)
        gap = next_entity.start_time - current.end_time
        
        if abs(gap) < 0.001:  # Essentially zero gap
            zero_gap_count += 1
            # Do NOT add buffer - would cause overlap
            continue
```

## Performance Characteristics
- **Processing rate**: ~44min for 81min audio
- **Transcription bottleneck**: 99.9% of processing time
- **Memory usage**: Bounded through streaming I/O
- **Zero-gap detection**: High percentage in continuous Colombian Spanish

## Required Test Audio
- `fixtures/spanish_complete_test.wav` (2-3 minute Spanish audio)

## Testing Commands  
```bash
./pytest_venv.sh tests/integration/test_stage6_pipeline.py -v
```

## Git Commit Pattern
```
Stage 6: Full pipeline integration complete

- Complete audio-to-JSON workflow operational
- Smart buffering for Colombian Spanish implemented  
- Zero-gap detection preventing word overlap
- Resumability framework in place
- All pipeline stages coordinated successfully
