## Risk Management

### **Phase 2A Risks (Core Automation)**

**High Risk**:
- **Handoff Generation Quality**: Auto-generated handoffs don't match manual quality
  - **Mitigation**: Use proven HANDOFF examples as validation benchmarks, extensive testing against manual standards

**Medium Risk**:
- **Context Isolation Accuracy**: Automated context selection misses critical information
  - **Mitigation**: Conservative approach including more context initially, learn from successful patterns

- **Contract Prediction Complexity**: Interface prediction fails for complex integration scenarios
  - **Mitigation**: Start with simpler contract patterns, iterative improvement based on validation failures

### **Phase 2B Risks (Domain Validation)**

**High Risk**:
- **Domain Transfer Failure**: Automation doesn't work outside ML integration context
  - **Mitigation**: Start with simpler scenarios, document domain-specific patterns systematically

**Medium Risk**:
- **Scalability Issues**: Automation breaks down with larger, more complex modules
  - **Mitigation**: Test with progressively larger modules, identify scalability limits early

### **Fallback Strategies**

**If Automation Quality < Manual Standards**:
- Hybrid approach: automated generation + human refinement
- Focus on highest-value automation (handoff generation) first
- Iterative improvement rather than complete automation

**If Domain Validation Fails**:
- Limit automation to proven domain (ML/data processing)
- Build domain-specific intelligence incrementally
- Maintain manual chunking as fallback for complex scenarios
